# codex-feishu-bridge

Thin Feishu-native relay for Codex native sessions.

## Goal

`codex-feishu-bridge` forwards Feishu input into real Codex sessions and sends Codex output back to Feishu. Codex native sessions are the single source of truth for conversation state.

## Principles

- Feishu is the control surface.
- Codex is the execution engine.
- Codex native sessions are the only session truth.
- The bridge stores only bindings and runtime metadata.
- Do not replay message history to simulate continuity.
- Do not create a second assistant/session abstraction above Codex.

## Scope

### In scope
- Feishu bot websocket ingress
- DM-first message handling
- Feishu conversation/thread to Codex session binding
- Create/resume/stop native Codex sessions
- Stream Codex output back to Feishu
- Minimal command set for control and status
- Small local metadata store for bindings and active-run locks

### Out of scope (initially)
- Broad plugin platform
- Independent long-term memory system
- Synthetic conversation storage
- Multi-provider orchestration
- Heavy card UX or product shell behavior

## Initial command ideas

- `/help`
- `/status`
- `/new`
- `/resume`
- `/session`
- `/stop`
- `/project`
- `/approvals`

## Status

Working v1 bridge:

- Feishu long-connection receive/send
- DM receive plus interactive-card replies
- conversation to native Codex session binding
- `/help` `/status` `/new` `/resume` `/session` `/stop` `/project` `/approvals` `/log`
- `/search` `/model` `/profile`
- `/git` `/pwd` `/ls` `/cat` `/tree` `/find` `/rg`
- `/project bind <path>` to rebind a conversation to another directory under the allowed project roots
- `/approvals` to switch the Codex approval mode used for future runs
- `/log [-n N] [--since <expr>] [--grep <text>]` to tail recent bridge service logs from systemd journal
- backend modes: `app-server`, `spawn`, and experimental `terminal`

## Run

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in Feishu credentials.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Start the bridge with `npm run dev`.

For a full local install from the current checkout, including package install, build, user unit install, and hard restart:

```bash
./install.sh
```

Or:

```bash
npm run install:local
```

## User Service

- Repo-owned systemd template: `deploy/systemd/codex-feishu-bridge.service.in`
- User config templates: `deploy/config/bridge.env.example` and `deploy/config/config.json`
- `config.json` is the primary bridge config. `bridge.env` is only for secrets,
  proxy/custom-CA settings, the config path, and similar process env.
- Optional startup-ready notification: set `FEISHU_STARTUP_NOTIFY_CHAT_ID` in `bridge.env`
  to get a one-time Feishu message after the websocket is connected and outbound
  message sending is working.
- Install or update the user service with:

```bash
./install.sh
```

- `install.sh` renders the current checkout path into the unit, writes the unit to:
  `~/.config/systemd/user/codex-feishu-bridge.service`
- `install.sh` builds a detached package payload, installs the global `codex-feishu-bridge`
  binary under your npm prefix, and points the user service at that binary.
- It preserves existing `~/.config/codex-feishu-bridge/bridge.env` and `config.json` if they
  already exist.
- Machine-specific proxy or custom CA settings should live in
  `~/.config/codex-feishu-bridge/bridge.env`, not in the repo-owned systemd unit template.
- Fresh installs rewrite the checked-in JSON template into a usable local config:
  `project.defaultPath` becomes the current checkout and `project.allowedRoots`
  includes that checkout.
- Project access is controlled by `project.allowedRoots`. `project.defaultPath`
  must stay under one of those allowed roots.
- `project.defaultSearchEnabled=true` makes new conversations and `/new`
  sessions default to live web search enabled.
- The checked-in JSON template defaults to `codex.backendMode = "app-server"`
  and `codex.sandboxMode = "default"` so approvals can be mediated in Feishu.
- The script asks for confirmation, then installs or updates the unit, reloads user systemd,
  enables the service, and performs a hard restart.

For local testing without Feishu, run `npm run cli -- --chat-id test-terminal`. This uses the same binding logic as Feishu `p2p:<chat_id>` conversations, so the chosen `chatId` becomes the reusable bridge conversation key.

## Backend Mode

- `codex.backendMode = "spawn"` starts one `codex exec` or `codex exec resume`
  process per turn while the bridge persists the native session id.
- `spawn` now emits lightweight progress updates such as session start, thinking, long-run heartbeat, and upstream websocket retry notices when Codex exposes them.
- `codex.backendMode = "app-server"` keeps a local
  `codex app-server` subprocess per bound native session and talks to it over
  stdio JSON-RPC for `thread/start`, `thread/resume`, `turn/start`,
  `turn/interrupt`, approval callbacks, and user-input requests.
- `codex.backendMode = "terminal"` is experimental. It is intended for a
  terminal-derived Codex experience projected into Feishu, but the current
  Codex interactive CLI is still a full-screen TUI and not yet reliable enough
  to use as the default backend.
- In `spawn`, `codex.sandboxMode = "workspace-write"` maps to Codex `--full-auto`.
- In `spawn`, `codex.sandboxMode = "danger-full-access"` maps to Codex `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`.
- In `app-server`, `codex.sandboxMode = "default"` maps to `sandbox=workspace-write` plus `approvalPolicy=on-request`.
- In `app-server`, `codex.sandboxMode = "danger-full-access"` maps to `sandbox=danger-full-access` plus `approvalPolicy=never`.
- `codex.approvalTimeoutMs` controls how long the bridge waits for a Feishu approval or user-input reply before sending a timeout-safe response back to Codex.
- `codex.runTimeoutMs` controls the maximum lifetime of one active Codex run
  before the bridge terminates it.
- `codex.spawn.statusIntervalMs` controls the heartbeat interval for long-running
  `spawn` turns. Set it to `0` to disable heartbeats.
- `feishu.sendRetry.maxAttempts`, `feishu.sendRetry.baseDelayMs`,
  `feishu.sendRetry.multiplier`, and `feishu.sendRetry.maxDelayMs` control
  retry/backoff for transient Feishu send failures such as `502`, `429`, and
  short network errors. `maxAttempts = 0` means one send attempt with no retry.
- `feishu.wsLoggerLevel` controls how much of the Feishu SDK websocket lifecycle is mirrored into the service logs.
- `feishu.reconnectReadyDebounceMs` controls how often the bridge may send a Feishu `Reconnected` ready card after websocket recovery.
- Outbound Feishu replies currently use interactive cards with a schema `2.0` markdown body, card title, chat-list summary, and per-reply header template color.
- `codex.terminal.flushIdleMs` controls the quiet window before terminal output
  is projected back to Feishu as one reply.
- `codex.terminal.flushMaxChars` caps one terminal-mode Feishu reply so noisy
  screens do not flood the chat.
- Numeric config values must be integers. Invalid values now fail fast during startup.

The bridge still accepts the old env-style JSON keys as a compatibility fallback,
but new config should use the structured schema.

## Feishu Rendering

- Inbound Feishu messages support both plain `text` and rich `post` payloads.
- Outbound replies use Feishu interactive cards.
- The card body keeps the same markdown content string the bridge generates, plus a raw fenced markdown appendix for clients that do not render every markdown feature consistently.
- Long replies are split on markdown block boundaries so fenced code blocks stay valid across chunks.

## Codex Profile Mode

- `codex.profileMode = "isolated"` gives the bridge its own Codex home. This is
  the default in development and is the safest mode for testing.
- `codex.profileMode = "personal"` points the bridge at your personal `~/.codex`
  so Feishu and your local terminal can reuse the same Codex sessions.
- `personal + spawn` is currently a compatibility mode, not the safest one. It may interfere with an interactive Codex instance that is already running against the same home.

## Session Binding

- Feishu does not provide a native Codex session id. The bridge binds a Feishu conversation key to a Codex session id in its local store.
- `p2p` chats bind on `p2p:<chat_id>`.
- If a conversation already has a bound session, the bridge reuses it.
- If a run is already active for that conversation, the bridge rejects a second concurrent turn instead of guessing which live run to reuse.
